Invariably, some of these are defective. Assuming the percentage of defective black-boxes made by AirCorp, BigSkies, and CharterUS are 4%, 6%, and 9%, respectively, find the probability that a randomly selected black-box from all black-boxes made that is found to be defective came from AirCorp.\n",
